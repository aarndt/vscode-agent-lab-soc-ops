## ✨ What is Soc Ops?

Soc Ops transforms awkward mixer small talk into an engaging game. Walk around, meet people, and discover who matches the prompts on your bingo card. First to get 5 in a row wins! 

Perfect for:
- 🏢 **Team building events** - Help new and existing team members connect
- 🎓 **Conferences & meetups** - Break down barriers between attendees  
- 🎉 **Social gatherings** - Turn any party into an interactive icebreaker
- 🚀 **Onboarding sessions** - Help newcomers quickly get to know everyone

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Open the game** on your phone or laptop
2. **Tap a square** to see the prompt (e.g., "Has lived in 3+ countries")
3. **Find someone** who matches that prompt
4. **Tap again** to mark it complete
5. **Get 5 in a row** (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) to win!

The game features randomized boards so everyone has a unique experience, encouraging broader mingling across the group.
